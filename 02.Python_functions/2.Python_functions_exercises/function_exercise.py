# 1st Question
# Write a function to count the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in
# the following string:
# "Hello, my name is John. I am a Python Programmer, I want to become an
# experienced Python Programmer"
# output:
# Lower case letters = 71
# Upper case letters = 8


# 2nd Question
# Write a function to get the factorial number, which is the product of
# all positive integers less than or equal to the given positive integer.
# Example:
# 6! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 = 720

# 3rd Question
# Write a function to get Fibonacci numbers, which is a series of numbers
# where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
# if x  = 10
# Solution 1 should equal = 55
# Solution 2 should be a list [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]


# 4th Question
# Write a function that returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two
# numbers.
# GCD is the greatest number or factor that both numbers can be divided by.
# Example 4, 8, 16 their GCD is 4
# 4 factors are 1 2 4
# 8 factors are 1 2 4 8
# 16 factors are 1 2 4 8 16
# GCD is 4 because it can be divided by all three numbers.
# Check the GCD rules online.
