# 1st Question
# Find the words that don't contain vowels in the below List the vowels list
# vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]
list_words = ["name",  "dry", "love", "cry", "run", "crypt", "Age", "Gym",
              "End", "Myth"]
# output:
# ['dry', 'cry', 'crypt', 'Gym', 'Myth']


# 2nd Question
# Get the square root and cubic root of the following list, round them to
# 2 digits, and store them in a dictionary.


numbers = [300, 456, 678, 899, 275, 358]
# output:
# {
# 300: [17.32, 6.69],
# 456: [21.35, 7.7],
# 678: [26.04, 8.79],
# 899: [29.98, 9.65],
# 275: [16.58, 6.5],
# 358: [18.92, 7.1]
# }


# 3rd Question
# use the keys in dict_one and values in dict_two to create a new dictionary
# using the above keys and values
dict_one = {"Color": "Red", "Vegetable": "Tomato", "Fruit": "Apple"}
dict_two = {"A": "Orange", "B": "Pumpkin", "C": "Orange"}

# Output = {'Color': 'Orange', 'Vegetable': 'Pumpkin', 'Fruit': 'Orange'}


# 4th Question

nest_list = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [44, 65, 76, 89],
    [33, 90, 10, 43, 88],
    [5, 7, 9]
    ]

# Output = [1, 2, 3, 44, 65, 76, 89, 33, 90, 10, 43, 88, 5, 7, 9]


# 5th Question
# Find the intersections in the following list, using reduce()
nest_list1 = [[89, 1, 2, 3, 44], [44, 65, 76, 89, 2], [2, 33, 90, 10, 44, 89]]
