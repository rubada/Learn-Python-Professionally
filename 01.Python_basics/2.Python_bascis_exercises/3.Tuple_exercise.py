# 1st question:
# Change the following tuple
# my_tuple = (44, 55, [66, 96, 45, 60], 89, 32)
# To the following:
# output: (44, 55, [66, 96, 785, 60], 89, 32)


# 2nd question:
# Unpack the following Tuple
# my_tuple = (65, 78, 84, ["red", "yellow", "green"])
# output should be:
# 65
# 78
# 84
# red
# greem
# yellow


# 3rd question:
# my_tuple = (44, 55, [66, 96, 45, 60], 89, 32)
# Add new_tuple = (2, 4, 8) to my_tuple
# Add new_list = [3, 8, "red"] to my_tuple
# what is the output?
