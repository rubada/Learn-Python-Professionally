# 1st question
# create a copy of the above set


# 2nd question
# Access the tuple inside new_set


# 3rd question
# add items in a set
# add cat and add [6, 9, "dog"] to new_set1
# and add below list to new_set1
my_list = ["mouse", "cat"]
new_set1 = {2, "Hello", False, (3, 7, 88)}


# 4th question
# Given the following sets:
a = {3, 4, 88, 9, 8, 200, 50}
