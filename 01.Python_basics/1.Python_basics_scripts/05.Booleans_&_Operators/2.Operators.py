# Arithmetic Operators +, -, *, /, %, **, //
x = 10
y = 6
# print(x/y)
# print(x//y)


# Assignment Operators =, +=, -=, etc., we can use them in loops
# x %= 4
# print(x)

# x += 10
# print(x)

# y //= 4
# print(y)

# y -= 1
# print(y)

# Comparison Operators ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, used in if-statement and
# other logical or function and method
a = 7
b = 8
# print(a == b)
# print(a != b)
# print(a >= b)
# print(7 >= a)
# print(8 <= b)

# Logical Operators, used in if-statement and other logical function and
# methods
# print(a == b and b > a)
# print(a <= b or b <= a)
# print(not a)

# Membership Operators in, not in, used with strings, lists, tuples
# sets, dictionary, and can be used in if statement and loops
c = "Python"
d = "P" in c
e = "r" not in c
# print(d)
# print(e)


# Bitwise Operators, Example where to use bitwise operation: encryption,
# compression, graphics, communications over ports/sockets, embedded systems
# programming and finite state machines
# print(5 & 9)
# print(5 | 9)
# print(5 ^ 9)
# print(5 << 2)

# ~4 means not 4, which changes all zeros to ones and all the ones to zeros and
# return the real number
# print(~4)
