# Comments Types
# 1. Comments that are identified with hash sign #
# 2. Docstrings

# Why comments are important?
# Comments are used to explain the code and make your code readable
# and clear.
# Comments are used to prevent the execution of some lines in your code.

# "a" is a string variable
# a = "This course is about Python"
# print(a)    # this function is used to show the output

# "b" is another variable
# "b" is an integer
b = 6
# print(b)

"""(c) is anothe variable
(c) is a float number"""

# or

'''(c) is another variable
(c) is a float number'''
c = 5.5


def add(b, c):
    """This function returns the sum of two numbers"""
    return b+c


# print(add(3, 4))
